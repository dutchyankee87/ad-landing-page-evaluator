# ðŸš¨ Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. **Build Succeeds but App Doesn't Work**

**Symptoms:**
- Vercel deployment shows "Success" 
- But website shows blank page or routing errors

**Solutions:**
- **Environment Variables**: Add these in Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL = https://fpmlwytpgwtnpjjvclld.supabase.co
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImZwbWx3eXRwZ3d0bnBqanZjbGxkIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTU1MjE5NjYsImV4cCI6MjA3MTA5Nzk2Nn0.L4kiHdFNT2AKsEPD6nrbX7bLjLh0ZxJt3bHeYaOuKp8
  ```

- **Redeploy**: After adding environment variables, trigger a new deployment

### 2. **Build Fails with Module Errors**

**Symptoms:**
- Build fails during the process
- Errors about missing modules or dependencies

**Solutions:**
- Check if latest commits are pushed to GitHub
- Verify `package.json` has correct dependencies structure

### 3. **Runtime Errors in Browser**

**Symptoms:**
- Site loads but crashes when using features
- Console errors about imports or modules

**Solutions:**
- Check browser console (F12) for specific error messages
- App should work in "fallback mode" even without Supabase connection

### 4. **Routing Issues (404 on Refresh)**

**Symptoms:**
- App works on homepage but 404 on subpages
- Refreshing any page shows "Not Found"

**Solutions:**
- `vercel.json` configuration should handle this (already updated)
- Ensures React Router works properly

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Function Logs
- Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Functions tab
- Look for any error logs

### 2. Check Build Logs
- Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Deployments
- Click on failed/problematic deployment
- View build logs for specific errors

### 3. Test Locally
```bash
# Build and serve locally to verify it works
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 4. Check Environment Variables
- Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
- Make sure both `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
- Values should NOT be wrapped in quotes in Vercel dashboard

### 5. Browser Console
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests

## Expected Behavior

### âœ… Working Deployment Should:
1. **Homepage loads** showing the evaluation form
2. **All pages accessible** (/, /evaluate, /results)
3. **Form works** - can select platform and upload images
4. **Evaluation completes** - shows mock results even without real API
5. **No console errors** - or only minor warnings

### ðŸš¨ Common Error Messages:

**"Failed to fetch"**
- Solution: Add environment variables in Vercel

**"Module not found"**
- Solution: Check if all dependencies are in correct package.json sections

**"Cannot read properties of undefined"**
- Solution: Usually environment variable missing

## Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Latest code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Environment variables added in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] New deployment triggered after adding environment variables
- [ ] No build errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] Browser console checked for errors

## Still Not Working?

**Try Alternative Deployment:**

### Option 1: Manual Deploy
```bash
# Build locally and drag to Netlify
npm run build
# Then drag the dist/ folder to netlify.com/drop
```

### Option 2: GitHub Pages
```bash
# Install gh-pages
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# Add to package.json scripts:
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"

# Deploy
npm run build && npm run deploy
```

Your app is designed to work even without backend setup, so it should at least show the interface and provide mock evaluations!
