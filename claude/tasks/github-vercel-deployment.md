# GitHub and Vercel Deployment Plan

## Overview
Deploy the Ad Landing Page Evaluator to GitHub and then to Vercel for public access.

## Plan

### 1. Repository Setup
- Initialize git repository in the project directory
- Create appropriate .gitignore file for React/Node.js project
- Add and commit all project files
- Create GitHub repository (will need user to do this or provide credentials)
- Add remote origin and push code

### 2. Vercel Deployment
- Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
- Configure build settings for Vite React app
- Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Deploy and verify functionality

### Environment Variables Needed for Vercel
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous public key

### Build Configuration
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Node.js version: 18.x (latest stable)

### Considerations
- Ensure all sensitive data is properly handled through environment variables
- Verify that the fallback mock evaluation works for users without Supabase access
- Test the deployed application thoroughly

## Reasoning
This deployment strategy ensures:
1. Version control and collaboration through GitHub
2. Automatic deployments on code changes via Vercel
3. Proper environment variable management
4. Static site optimization for fast loading

## Review

### Completed Tasks
✅ **Git Repository Setup**
- Initialized git repository with proper .gitignore for React/Vite projects
- Added comprehensive environment variable exclusions
- Renamed default branch from master to main for GitHub best practices

✅ **GitHub Integration**
- Created initial commit with detailed commit message
- Successfully pushed to GitHub repository: `dutchyankee87/ad-landing-page-evaluator`
- Repository includes all project files except sensitive data and build artifacts

✅ **Deployment Preparation**
- Configured proper .gitignore for production builds
- Verified project structure is compatible with Vercel deployment
- Prepared environment variable configuration instructions

### Key Accomplishments
- **36 files committed** including complete React TypeScript application
- **Platform-specific evaluation system** with support for Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Google Ads, and Reddit
- **Supabase Edge Functions** for AI-powered analysis with OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- **Fallback mock evaluation** ensures application works without API dependencies
- **Production-ready build configuration** with Vite and Tailwind CSS

### Repository Structure
- Clean separation of concerns with React Context API state management
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Comprehensive form validation and multi-step user experience
- AI integration through Supabase Edge Functions
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Next Steps for User
1. Complete Vercel deployment using the provided instructions
2. Configure Supabase environment variables in Vercel dashboard (optional)
3. Test the deployed application with mock evaluation
4. Set up production Supabase project and OpenAI API key for full functionality

The application is now ready for production deployment and will provide users with a comprehensive ad-to-landing-page evaluation tool.
