## Technical Implementation Details

### Storage Architecture
```typescript
// Supabase Storage Structure
buckets/
├── ad-images/
│   ├── original/         // Full resolution uploads
│   ├── thumbnails/       // 300x300 previews
│   └── compressed/       // WebP optimized versions
└── landing-screenshots/
    ├── full/            // Full page screenshots
    ├── above-fold/      // Hero section only
    └── mobile/          // Mobile viewport captures
```

### Database Schema Enhancements
```sql
-- Add to existing evaluations table
ALTER TABLE evaluations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS
  ad_image_file_size INTEGER,
  screenshot_file_size INTEGER,
  visual_similarity_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  industry_percentile INTEGER;

-- New tables for Phase 2+
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  evaluation_ids UUID[],
  session_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

CREATE TABLE benchmark_cache (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  cache_key TEXT UNIQUE,
  benchmark_data JSONB,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### Cost Projections

**Monthly Operating Costs**:
- **Supabase Database**: $25 (Pro plan)
- **Storage (1000 evals/month)**: $50
- **Edge Function compute**: $20
- **Screenshot service**: $30
- **Total**: ~$125/month

**Revenue Projections**:
- **Free tier**: 80% of users (evaluation only)
- **Pro tier ($29/month)**: 18% of users (history + benchmarks)
- **Enterprise ($299/month)**: 2% of users (API + custom features)
- **At 1000 monthly users**: $6,000-10,000/month revenue

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Storage costs scaling**: Implement aggressive compression and CDN
- **Screenshot reliability**: Multiple fallback services
- **Database performance**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **GDPR compliance**: Built-in data export and deletion tools

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Freemium model reduces friction
- **Competition**: Focus on data moat and proprietary insights
