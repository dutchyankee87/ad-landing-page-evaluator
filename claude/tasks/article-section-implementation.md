# Article Section Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a dedicated article section for adalign.io to provide valuable content to users about ad optimization, landing page best practices, and industry insights. This will help with SEO, establish authority, and provide value to users beyond just the evaluation tool.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Component Architecture
- Create `ArticleSection.tsx` component that will be reusable
- Design for integration into the Home page between existing sections
- Use consistent styling with the current design system (Tailwind CSS)
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 2. Article Data Structure
- Create TypeScript interfaces for Article type
- Include fields: id, title, excerpt, content, author, date, readTime, category, tags, slug
- Design for future expansion to full blog functionality
- Consider SEO-friendly URL structure

### 3. Content Strategy
Focus on 3-4 high-value articles related to:
- Ad optimization best practices
- Landing page conversion tips
- Platform-specific guides (Meta, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn)
- Case studies and success stories

### 4. Design Approach
- Match existing homepage visual style with gradient cards
- Use grid layout for article previews
- Include author info, read time, and category tags
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

### 5. Integration Plan
- Add ArticleSection between "Social Proof" and "Final CTA" sections on Home page
- Ensure proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Maintain existing page flow and user journey

### 6. Future Considerations
- Structure allows for easy expansion to full blog/CMS
- SEO optimization with proper meta tags
- Potential for individual article pages
- RSS feed capability
- Social sharing functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create/Modify
1. `src/components/ArticleSection.tsx` - Main article section component
2. `src/types/article.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
3. `src/data/articles.ts` - Sample article data
4. `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Integration point

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing Lucide React icons
- Leverages current Tailwind CSS setup
- Compatible with existing React Router structure

## Success Criteria
- Article section displays properly on homepage
- Responsive design works across all devices
- Consistent with existing design language
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Performance impact is minimal
- SEO-friendly structure

## Timeline
Estimated 2-3 hours of development time for complete implementation including testing and refinement.
