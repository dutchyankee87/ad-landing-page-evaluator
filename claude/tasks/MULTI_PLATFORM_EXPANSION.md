# Multi-Platform Ad Landing Page Evaluator Expansion Plan

## Project Goals
Expand the current Meta-focused ad evaluator to support multiple advertising platforms (TikTok, LinkedIn, Google Ads, Reddit) using preview links instead of just image uploads. Create a comprehensive audit system that matches ads with landing pages across all platforms.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ React 18 + TypeScript + Vite architecture
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions with OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- ✅ Multi-step form with file upload capability
- ✅ Mock evaluation fallback system
- ✅ Score visualization and recommendations

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Platform Support Strategy
**MVP Phase: Multi-Platform Screenshot Support**
1. **Primary Method: Screenshot Upload**
   - Users screenshot their ads from any platform (Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Google, Reddit)
   - Works for all static ads across platforms
   - No platform-specific API integrations needed
   - Immediate multi-platform support

2. **Platform Selection**
   - Dropdown to specify platform (Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Google Ads, Reddit)
   - Platform-specific evaluation criteria and best practices
   - Tailored recommendations per platform

**Future Enhancement: Preview Link Integration**
- Meta preview links: `https://fb.me/adspreview/facebook/[ID]`
- Automated scraping for supported platforms
- Fallback to screenshot method for unsupported platforms

### 2. Preview Link Integration Architecture

#### Frontend Changes
- **New Component**: `PreviewLinkForm.tsx`
  - URL validation for each platform
  - Platform auto-detection from URL patterns
  - Preview rendering capability
  - Fallback to image upload option

- **Enhanced AdAssetForm**: 
  - Tab-based interface: "Upload Images" vs "Preview Links"
  - Platform selector dropdown
  - URL input with real-time validation
  - Preview display before submission

#### Platform URL Patterns (Examples Needed)
```typescript
const PLATFORM_PATTERNS = {
  meta: /facebook\.com\/ads\/library\/preview/,
  tiktok: /ads\.tiktok\.com\/preview/,
  linkedin: /linkedin\.com\/campaign-manager\/preview/,
  google: /ads\.google\.com\/preview/,
  reddit: /ads\.reddit\.com\/preview/
}
```

### 3. Backend Enhancement Strategy

#### Supabase Edge Function Updates
- **New Function**: `scrape-ad-preview`
  - Platform-specific scraping logic
  - Image extraction from preview pages
  - Metadata collection (platform, format, dimensions)
  - Error handling for private/expired links

- **Enhanced**: `evaluate-ad` function
  - Platform-aware evaluation criteria
  - Multi-format support (image, video, carousel)
  - Platform-specific best practices integration

### 4. LLM Integration Strategy for Image-to-Page Matching

#### Recommended Architecture: **Multi-Modal Approach**

**Option A: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision (Recommended)**
- **Pros**: Built-in vision capabilities, excellent reasoning
- **Cons**: Cost, API limits
- **Implementation**: 
  ```typescript
  // Send both ad image and landing page screenshot
  const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: [
        { type: "text", text: "Analyze ad-to-landing page congruence..." },
        { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: adImageUrl }},
        { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: landingPageScreenshot }}
      ]
    }]
  });
  ```

**Option B: Anthropic Claude 3 (Alternative)**
- **Pros**: Strong analytical capabilities, cost-effective
- **Cons**: Separate vision API needed
- **Implementation**: Similar multi-modal approach

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (Most Robust)**
- **Primary**: GPT-4 Vision for visual analysis
- **Secondary**: Text-based analysis for content matching
- **Fallback**: Rule-based scoring when APIs unavailable

#### Enhanced Evaluation Criteria by Platform

**Meta/Facebook Ads:**
- Visual brand consistency
- CTA button alignment
- Social proof correlation
- Mobile optimization check

**TikTok Ads:**
- Video-to-page energy matching
- Youth-oriented design alignment
- Mobile-first optimization
- Trend-aware content analysis

**LinkedIn Ads:**
- Professional tone consistency
- B2B value proposition alignment
- Corporate branding coherence
- Lead generation flow optimization

**Google Ads:**
- Search intent alignment
- Keyword relevance check
- Landing page speed correlation
- Quality Score factors
