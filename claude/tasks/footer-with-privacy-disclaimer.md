# Footer with Privacy Statement and Disclaimer

## Plan

I need to create a comprehensive footer component for adalign.io that includes:

### Components to Create/Modify:
1. **Footer Component** (`src/components/Footer.tsx`)
   - Replace the simple footer in App.tsx with a comprehensive component
   - Include multiple sections: navigation, legal, company info

### Footer Structure:
1. **Navigation Links**
   - Internal links to: Home, Evaluate, Pricing, Articles
   - Quick access to key functionality

2. **Legal Section**
   - Privacy Policy statement
   - Terms of Service
   - Disclaimer about AI analysis accuracy
   - GDPR/data handling notice

3. **Company Information**
   - Copyright notice
   - Contact information placeholder
   - Social media links (prepared for future use)

### Technical Implementation:
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use React Router Link components for internal navigation
- Structure with semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels

### Content Strategy:
- **Privacy Statement**: Brief statement about data handling with link to full policy
- **Disclaimer**: Clear statement about AI analysis being for informational purposes
- **Terms**: Reference to terms of service
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about data usage in ad analysis

### Integration:
- Replace the simple footer in App.tsx (lines 35-39)
- Import and use the new Footer component
- Maintain existing styling patterns and layout structure

This approach will provide users with necessary legal information while maintaining trust and transparency about the AI-powered analysis service.
